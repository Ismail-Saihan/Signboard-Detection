# Signboard-Detection

## Image Recognition Project with YOLO for Signboard Detection:
◦ Developed an image recognition system using YOLOv8 for real-time detection of various signboard types,
including traffic signs and advertising boards.
◦ Created a custom dataset of signboard images by sourcing my own photos.
◦ Annotated images with tools like Labeling for bounding box creation.
◦ Applied data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustment to enhance
model generalization.
